# Steam-ID-Swapper
Swaps a steam vanity URL from one account to another

*Chrome required

How to use: 

*Make sure to edit the windowresizer, swapcheck & swap ahk scripts so they suit your resolution, otherwise you are not doing anything.

1. Start Window-Resizer.ahk 
2. Press F and it'll start chrome and 4 other windows (incognito) 
3. Log into the account with the ID on the normal chrome, and the account the ID should go to on one of the incognito windows
4. After logging in go to edit profile on all 5 windows, type something random on the ID on the first window and the ID on the other 4 correctly
5. while the Window-Resizer.ahk is working, separate all windows and use the numbers 1-5 to resize into smaller windows.
6. After you are done and all 5 windows are under each other (with the ID one being on top) in your top left corner, close the window-resizer.ahk.
7. Start swap.ahk and press 1. You can also press 2 instantly after to make sure everything is good (will click the 4 incognito windows' save buttons again)

//*The normal chrome window will be used to release the ID whilst the other 4 incognito tabs will be the same account that will attempt to claim the ID 4 times so it doesn't  mess up the claim request.*//


Done, you have successfully swapped your ID! Congratulations!  You are no longer a handswaptard that will complain after losing his id because he missclicked the button or delayed the req.
