# Steam-ID-Swapper
Swaps a steam vanity URL from one browser to another

*Chrome recommended

How to use: 

*Make sure to edit the windowresizer, swapcheck & swap ahk scripts so they suit your resolution, otherwise you are not doing anything.
*I wont help you update it for your resolution, figure it out yourself its not that hard.

1. Open chrome & start another incognito window.
2. Open 3 more tabs in the incognito window and use the "WindowResizer" to resize the windows so the program can click on all 5 buttons.

//*The normal chrome window will be used to release the ID whilst the other 4 incognito tabs will be the same account that will attempt to claim the ID 4 times so it doesn't  mess up the claim request.*//


Done, you have successfully swapped your ID! Congratulations!  You are no longer a handswaptard that will complain after losing his id because he missclicked the button or delayed the req.
