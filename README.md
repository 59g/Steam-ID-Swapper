*Chrome recommended
How to use: 

1. Open chrome + an incognito window with the main window
2. Use Windows+L Windows+R to divide both windows equally to the size of your screen to see both "Save" buttons at "Edit Profile" 
3. Find and replace the coordinates of the screen for both buttons in function F1 and function F2

Done, you have successfully swapped your ID! Congratulations!  You are no longer a handswaptard that will complain after losing his id because he missclicked the button.
