# Steam-Swapper
Swaps a steam vanity URL from one browser to another

*Chrome recommended

How to use: 

1. Open chrome + an incognito window with the main window
2. Use Windows+L Windows+R to divide both windows equally to the size of your screen to see both "Save" buttons.
3. Find and replace the coordinates of the screen for both buttons in the script

Done, you have successfully swapped your ID! Congratulations!  You are no longer a handswaptard that will complain after losing his id because he missclicked the button.
